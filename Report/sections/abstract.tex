This project presents a novel approach to enhancing the Differentiable Search Index (DSI), a neural inverted index framework, by introducing three data augmentation techniques: (1) converting numerical values to words (Num2Word), (2) removing stopwords, and (3) leveraging a Part of Speech Masked Language Modeling (POS-MLM) strategy. These augmentations aim to improve the robustness and effectiveness of the DSI model in diverse retrieval scenarios. Additionally, we propose and evaluate four advanced variants of the DSI model: DSI+LoRA, DSI+QLoRA, DSI+ALoRA, and DSI+ConvoLoRA, which integrate parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods to optimize performance and resource utilization.
