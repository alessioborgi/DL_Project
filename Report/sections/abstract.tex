In this project report we present a novel Differentiable Search Indexing (DSI) approach. Unlike traditional contrastive learning-based dual encoders, this architecture maps a query to its relevant document identifier (docid) during inference, enabling efficient retrieval with standard model inference and optional beam search for ranking. We explore advanced indexing methods, including semantic and syntactic data augmentation techniques like stopword removal, Num2Text transformation, and POS-MLM augmentation, to enhance dataset quality. Our model innovations feature dynamic pruning for efficient training, parameter-efficient fine-tuning via LoRA, and memory optimization through QLoRA with 4-bit quantization.
